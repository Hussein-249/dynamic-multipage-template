> An Express template / project to provide a solution for managing large websites, aimed for blogs and news sites.

# Purpose

Web applications and web sites whose main method of content delivery is through a large number of pages require a scalable method of delivery. This project aims to serve as a template for building apps while keeping code low, aside from customization choices asuch as styling or frontend features.

# Technologies Used

The serverside code is written in Javascript using Node, and requires the following npm packages:

- Bootstrap for responsive and accessible styling
- Express for middleware
- ejs for templating
- mongodb for interacting with a mongodb database
- redis for cacheing commonly-used elements across pages

MongoDB is used to serve article / blog content and media.
